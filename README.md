# Chemical Steganography

Chemical steganography is a technique for hiding messages within the chemical composition of substances or reactions. This repository contains implementations and resources related to chemical steganography.

## Overview

Chemical steganography offers a covert communication method that can be less susceptible to detection compared to traditional digital methods. By embedding messages within the properties of chemical substances, it provides an alternative approach to secure communication.

## Features

- Encoding and decoding algorithms for hiding and extracting messages within chemical compounds.
- Example implementations demonstrating the use of chemical steganography in various scenarios.
- Resources and documentation for understanding the principles and techniques of chemical steganography.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chemical-steganography.git
 

2. Navigate to the project directory:

 
   cd chemical-steganography
 

3. Run the encoding and decoding scripts:

  
   python encode.py
   python decode.py
